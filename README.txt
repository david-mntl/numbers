 
To properly run the program it is needed to install all the dependencies in the file named "dependencies.txt"

To train de the model:

$python3 initTraining.py

To predict and init the evaluation method implemented:
$python3 predictSVM.py

How to use it:

- When running predictSVM click on the "StartRecording" button to record an audio. When you are finished recording click on stop recording.
- Click on the "Graph audio" button to see the signal plotted
- Click on the "predict" button to predict the recorded audio with the already trained model. It will display the prediction in the box on the top right of the screen
